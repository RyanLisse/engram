# Troubleshooting

- Convex codegen fails: run `npx convex deploy` and re-run codegen.
- MCP tool error: verify `CONVEX_URL` and `ENGRAM_AGENT_ID`.
- Empty recall: confirm agent has scope permissions.
- Missing notifications: verify enrichment and route actions are enabled.
- Vault sync issues: check `VAULT_ROOT` and markdown write permissions.
