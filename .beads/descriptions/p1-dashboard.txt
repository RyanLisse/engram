Dashboard event type handling (optional). File: dashboard app (e.g. page.tsx). Ensure stats use event.type === "fact_stored" and event.type === "recall"; optionally accept fact.stored / recall_completed during transition. After Phase 1.1 only normalized names will be sent. Verification: start MCP with ENGRAM_SSE_PORT, open dashboard, trigger memory_store_fact and memory_recall; dashboard shows Facts Stored and Recalls incrementing with types fact_stored / recall.
