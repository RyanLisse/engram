Emit events for mutations. Convex: ensure mutations that perform high-value ops insert into memory_events (or call shared emit helper). Emit: facts.updateFact → fact_updated; archiveFactPublic → fact_archived; forget → fact_forgotten; session summary/end_session → session_ended; themes.create → theme_created; optional entity_deleted, config_updated. Files: convex/functions/facts.ts, forget path, session end path, themes.ts. Use eventType fact.updated etc.; Phase 1.1 normalizer maps to fact_updated. Ensure memory_forget HTTP path can trigger emit. Extend normalizer in Phase 1.1 for new types. Plan Phase 4.
