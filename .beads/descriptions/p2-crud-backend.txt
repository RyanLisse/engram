CRUD backend (Convex). Add mutations: (1) episodes.deleteEpisode in convex/functions/episodes.ts — delete by episodeId, check scope/agent; add to PATHS and convex-client. (2) memoryBlocks.blockDelete in convex/functions/memoryBlocks.ts — by scopeId+label or blockId; PATHS and convex-client memory-blocks. (3) agents.updateAgent in convex/functions/agents.ts — agentId, name?, capabilities?, defaultScope?, telos?, settings?; PATHS and convex-client. Ensure themes.update and subspaces.deleteSubspace are exposed in PATHS/convex-client. Plan Phase 2.2.
