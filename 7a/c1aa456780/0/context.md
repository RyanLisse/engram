# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Base directory for this skill: /Users/cortex-air/.claude/skills/beads-workflow

# Beads Workflow — From Plan to Actionable Tasks

> **Core Principle:** "Check your beads N times, implement once" — where N is as many as you can stomach.
>
> Beads are so detailed and polished that you can mechanically unleash a big swarm of agents to implement them, and it will come out just about perfectly.

## What Are Beads?

Beads are **epics/tasks/subtasks with dependency structure**, optimized for AI...

### Prompt 2

Base directory for this skill: /Users/cortex-air/.claude/plugins/cache/every-marketplace/compound-engineering/2.30.0/skills/brainstorming

# Brainstorming

This skill provides detailed process knowledge for effective brainstorming sessions that clarify **WHAT** to build before diving into **HOW** to build it.

## When to Use This Skill

Brainstorming is valuable when:
- Requirements are unclear or ambiguous
- Multiple approaches could solve the problem
- Trade-offs need to be explored with th...

lets start implementing using the /agent-swarm-workflow

### Prompt 5

Base directory for this skill: /Users/cortex-air/.claude/skills/agent-swarm-workflow

# Agent Swarm Workflow — Parallel Implementation

> **Core Insight:** Every agent is fungible and a generalist. They all use the same base model and read the same AGENTS.md. Simply telling one it's a "frontend agent" doesn't make it better at frontend.
>
> The swarm is distributed, robust, and self-organizing through Agent Mail and Beads.

Before starting a swarm:

1. **Comprehensive p...

### Prompt 7

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial request**: User invoked `/beads-workflow` skill with the plan file `docs/plans/2026-02-27-feat-cross-agent-engram-mcp-enforcement-plan.md` — wanting to convert it into beads.

2. **Plan reading & bead creation (Wave 0)**: I read the plan (262 lines), reviewed existing ba...

### Prompt 8

continue another wave use codex 5.3 to code

### Prompt 9

Base directory for this skill: /Users/cortex-air/.claude/skills/codex-team

# Codex Team

The lead orchestrates, Codex agents execute. Each agent gets one focused task. The team lead prevents file conflicts before spawning — the orchestrator IS the lock manager.

## When to Use

- You have 2+ tasks (bug fixes, implementations, refactors)
- Tasks are well-scoped with clear instructions
- You want Codex execution with predictable isolation
- You may be in Claude or Codex runtime (skill auto-sel...
