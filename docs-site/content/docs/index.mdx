## What is Engram?

Engram is like a shared notebook for your AI assistants — when one assistant learns something, the others can remember it too. It stores facts, finds them later using meaning (not just keywords), and keeps everything synced across your devices.

Think of it as giving your AI agents a long-term memory they can all share.

## What You'll Need

- **Node.js** (version 18+) — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **A free Convex account** — [convex.dev](https://www.convex.dev)
- **Claude Code** (or another MCP-compatible AI client)
- **A Cohere API key** (optional) — enables real semantic search. Free tier at [cohere.com](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)

## Setup in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Download Engram

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyanLisse/engram.git
cd engram
```

### Step 2: Set Up Convex Backend

```bash
npm install
npx convex dev
```

This will:
1. Ask you to log in to Convex (creates a free account if needed)
2. Create a new project
3. Give you a deployment URL like `https://happy-animal-123.convex.cloud`

Leave this terminal running and open a **new terminal** for the next steps.

### Step 3: Configure Environment

```bash
cd engram/mcp-server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `mcp-server` folder:

```bash
CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
ENGRAM_AGENT_ID=my-assistant
COHERE_API_KEY=  # optional
```

### Step 4: Build the Server

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Connect to Claude Code

Add to your `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "engram": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/engram/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CONVEX_URL": "https://your-deployment.convex.cloud",
        "ENGRAM_AGENT_ID": "my-assistant",
        "COHERE_API_KEY": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. You should now see Engram's 12 memory tools available.

## Your First Memory

**Store a fact:**

> "Remember that my preferred programming language is Python."

The assistant calls `memory_store_fact` and saves this to your shared memory.

**Recall it later (even in a new conversation):**

> "What do you remember about my programming preferences?"

The assistant calls `memory_recall`, searches by meaning, and finds the fact — even if you used different words.

## Common Questions

**What if I don't have a Cohere API key?**
Engram works without one. Semantic search will be less precise, but all 12 tools function normally. Add a key later — no data is lost.

**Can multiple agents share memory?**
Yes. Each agent gets its own ID and memories can be scoped as private, team, project, or public.

**Does it work offline?**
The current version requires Convex connectivity. A future update will add local-only mode via LanceDB.
